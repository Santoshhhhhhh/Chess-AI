that we have our functioning chess board, let's start building our first AI Agent, using a tree-based algorithm called MiniMax.\n\nIt is called minimax, because it has 2 different goals: maximize your

depth 2:\n- for each valid move (my_move):\n    - for each opponent valid move compute the board score after that move\n    - take opponent MAX possible score\n- choose my_move such that we take the MIN of the opponent MAX scores\n\nand so on recursively.\n\n![minimax](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MandM-DataScience/chess-engine/master/images/400px-Minimax.svg.png)\n\nFirst thing, we need a
